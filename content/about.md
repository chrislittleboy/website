title: About me
---

I am an early career researcher in development economics. I am now starting out in the academic world after spending the previous three years conducting my PhD research on land rights in Nigeria. What I love about my topic is that to understand it properly one has to combine three different disciplines: economics, geography and politics. This means that there are typically lots of differences between scholars who research the issues, which helps to keep the debates lively! You'll get a better flavour of my research interests from the posts. Outside academica, I am fortunate to live in Edinburgh which is in touching distance of the Scottish highlands. So when my eyes have had too much computer time I can head to the hills.
