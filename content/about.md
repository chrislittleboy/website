I am an early career researcher in development economics. I am now starting out in the academic world after spending the previous three years conducting my PhD research on land rights in Nigeria. What I love about my topic is that it combines three different disciplines: economics, geography and politics. The debates are lively and the perspectives are broad! You'll get a better flavour of my research interests and views from the posts. Outside academia, I am fortunate to live in Edinburgh which is in touching distance of the Scottish highlands. So when my eyes have had too much computer time I can head to the hills.
