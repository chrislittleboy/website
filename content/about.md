I am a Postdoc at Stirling University starting out my academic career.
I love teaching and research, and work to understand links between natural resources and development.
Currently I am working on the Beacon Project at the University of Stirling in central Scotland. The project looks at the pros and cons of large dam infrastructure. This is firstly a deep-dive into four case study contexts (India, Brazil, Kazakhstan, and Scotland) and secondly a global comparative analysis of dam impacts using satellite imagery.

**Education**

PhD (2017-2021), Development Economics. *School of Oriental and African Studies*.

MSc (2014-2015), Research for International Development. *School of Oriental and African Studies*.

BMus (2011-2014), Music. *King's College London*.

**Skills**

*Quantitative*: GIS, earth observation, econometrics; spatial analysis; cluster analysis; agent-based modelling.

*Qualitative*: international fieldwork experience; CAPI surveys; sampling. 

*Theory*: new institutional economics; property rights; game theory;  social ontology.

*Programming*: R (expert); Python; C++; web delopment (html/css/JS with PostgreSQL and PostGIS).

*Other*: teaching; curriculum development; tutoring; supervision; marking.

**Publications and future plans**

I have one accepted paper at *Land Use Policy* on measuring the scarcity of agricultural land by combining household survey data and earth observation.

Four papers are currently under review, in the system. These are:

- Protecting more forests will not reverse deforestation (Nature Ecology and Evolution);
- Customary tenure and land reform in Nigeria: theory and reality in policy;
- damAOI: an R package to define an "Area of Interest" around dams for impact assessment;
- A seasonal classification system interpolating biome classifications within the year for better temporal aggregation in climate science

In the pipeline for this year is:

- A case study paper on water scarcity and irrigation infrastructure on the Syr Darya river basin, in collaboration with Kazakh researchers.
- A website to visualize how landscapes change after large dams are built for 320 big dams globally.
- A paper exploring the drivers between land cover changes following dam construction.
