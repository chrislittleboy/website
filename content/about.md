I am a Postdoc at Stirling University starting out my academic career.
In my research I use data science to understand interactions between the environment and economic development.

Currently I am building an agent-based model to simulate encroachment on protected forests.
This is an exciting and topical area of research following the COP26 commitments to end deforestation.
The model can be used to predict outcomes in the near future for 14,000+ forests across the globe.

During my PhD I researched the influence of land scarcity on land management and agriculture in rural Nigeria.
